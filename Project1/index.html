        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Conor Napier, I am a digital artist, illustrator, and game designer. I am presently pursuing a graduate degree in digital media design here at Harvard Extension. I'm from the Boston area and I have lived here my whole life. I presently work for a nonprofit north of Boston called NuPath as a Marketing Coordinator and Graphic Designer. I am also the cofounder/co owner of a small tabletop game company, Gemhammer and Sons.
          My hobbies include hiking, gaming (D&D and Destiny primarily), reading, and listening to music.
