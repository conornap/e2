// * Define a winner variable, that is null to start with
// * Player A and B each pick evens or odds 
//     * Player A checks off a box to determine evens or odds
//     * Player B chooses
//         * Use Rand function to select 1 or 2
//             * 1 for odds
//             * 2 for evens
// * Each Player rolls a six sided dice
//     * Use rand function to select a number from 1-6
//     * Use the selected number to determine each player's roll
//     * Add the two rolls together
//     * Determine if the result is even or odd
// * If Player A's guess and the result match, they win
//     * Compare Player A's guess to the result and check for a match
//     * If Player B's guess is a match, Player B wins
//     * If Player A and Player B's guesses both match the result, then its a tie
//     * If neither Player A nor Player B's guess match the result, then its a draw
